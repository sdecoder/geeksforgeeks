Steiner Tree Problem
What is Steiner Tree?
Given a graph and a subset of vertices in the graph, a steiner tree spans though the given
subset. The Steiner Tree may contain some vertices which are not in given subset but are
used to connect the vertices of subset.

The given set of vertices is called Terminal Vertices and other vertices that are used to
construct Steiner tree are called Steiner vertices.
